## Vue Js with Laravel

#### What is Vue JS?

Vue is a progressive framework for creating impressive user interfaces. If looked at its core, it is focused on the view layer of an application.

To integrate Vue JS with various other platforms or existing applications is quite simple.

It is extensible, simple, interesting and innovative to create single web page applications.

Data binding is a big problem for the front end world. Now, we are more focused on data instead of micromanaging the DOM as we used to do it with Jquery in the past. 
Vue has the amazing capability of handling this easily with a two-way reactive data binding system.

#### Why should we use Vue JS with Laravel?

VueJS allows the Laravel developers to create the front end in a way that their application does not have to reload the page every time an update is made.

Vue helps you create a full-scale application that is event-driven and has all activity completely handle on the frontend. 
But it also offers composable components that can be used as the user wishes to use them.

Since Vue.js integrates well with Laravel, developers require making only a few trips to request data from their Laravel application and create changes just 
by switching components without reloading the page.

When your software application is created with Vue components, the dependencies of every component are automatically tracked at the time it is rendered. Due to this, 
the system knows precisely which component actually requires to be updated when there is a change in the existing data.

Vuejs permits Laravel developers to create an optimal single page application that is easy to operate. 
As the complete assets of the application get loaded at once and make it simple to use the application comfortably and in an easier manner.

Vue.js is an easy platform to adopt as a developer. It offers you very few options that make you feel like a sophisticated developer, 
on the other hand, has a lot to offer in an abstracted way.

Another interesting thing about Vue is that your valid HTML is also a valid Vue template. You can keep your CSS external or you can directly process it with Javascript depending on your application requirements.

Moreover, you can also take benefit of scoped styling, to apply style changes to a single component on the fly without the change affecting other components.
